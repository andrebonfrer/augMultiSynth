\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{fit}: result of \code{multiout_synth()}
\item \code{sim}: simulated data object
\item \code{cor}: length-M correlations for k=0 unit effects (treated subset)
\item \code{rmse}: length-M RMSE for k=0 unit effects (treated subset)
\item \code{avg_1K}: list from \code{eval_avg_1K()} (unit-level avg(1:K) accuracy)
\item \code{shrink}: list from \code{multisynth_shrink()} (if enabled), plus accuracy vs truth
}
}
\description{
Simulates a staggered-adoption multi-outcome panel with latent factor structure,
fits multi-outcome augmented synthetic control (optionally with pooled intercept
adjustment), and reports accuracy diagnostics for unit-level treatment effects.

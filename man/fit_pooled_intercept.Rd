\title{Fit pooled regression adjustment for synthetic predictions (intercept-only)}
\usage{
fit_pooled_intercept(y_pre, ysc_pre, nu = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{y_pre}{numeric vector of observed outcomes stacked over (i,t) in pre-periods.}

\item{ysc_pre}{numeric vector of synthetic predictions stacked over (i,t) in pre-periods.}

\item{nu}{nonnegative ridge penalty for the pooled intercept.}
}
\value{
Estimated intercept adjustment beta0.
}
\description{
Given unit-specific synthetic predictions for treated units in their pre-periods,
estimate a single pooled intercept adjustment beta0 (per outcome) via ridge:
min_b sum (Y - Ysc - b)^2 + nu * b^2
}

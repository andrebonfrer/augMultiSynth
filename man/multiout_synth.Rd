}
\arguments{
\item{Y_list}{List of outcome matrices, each \code{N x T}. All must share \code{N} and \code{T}.}

\item{treat_time}{Numeric vector length \code{N} giving first treated period for each unit
(or \code{Inf} for never-treated).}

\item{treated_units}{Optional integer vector of treated unit indices to estimate.
Defaults to all units with finite \code{treat_time}.}

\item{L}{Integer. Number of pre-treatment periods used to fit weights and (if enabled)
compute intercept shifts.}

\item{K}{Integer. Maximum event time; returns effects for \code{k=0,...,K}.}

\item{max_donors}{Integer. Maximum donor set size after screening. Defaults to \code{1000}.}

\item{screen_outcome}{Integer. Index in \code{Y_list} to use for donor screening.
Defaults to \code{1}.}

\item{screen_method}{Screening method for donors. \code{"cor"} or \code{"mse"}.}

\item{demean}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, demeans pre-treatment stacked design before fitting.
Recommended when using intercept-shift interpretation.}

\item{lambda}{Nonnegative scalar ridge penalty on weights in the solver.}

\item{solver}{Solver choice. Currently \code{"fw"} (Frank–Wolfe).}

\item{pooled_adjustment}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, estimates a pooled intercept correction
per outcome from pre-treatment residuals across treated units (multisynth-like).}

\item{nu}{Nonnegative ridge penalty for the pooled intercept correction (per outcome).
Larger \code{nu} shrinks the pooled intercept toward zero.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, prints progress.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\describe{
\item{weights}{A named list of donor weight vectors, one per treated unit.}
\item{donors}{A named list of donor index vectors, one per treated unit.}
\item{tau}{A 3D array of dimension \code{J x M x (K+1)} containing treatment effects,
where \code{J = length(treated_units)} and \code{M = length(Y_list)}.}
\item{treated_units}{Integer vector of treated units used in estimation.}
\item{pooled_beta0}{NULL or numeric vector length \code{M} of pooled intercept adjustments.}
\item{pooled_adjustment}{Logical flag as passed in.}
\item{nu}{Penalty parameter used for pooled adjustment.}
}
}
\description{
Estimates donor weights and unit-level event-time treatment effects for multiple
outcomes in staggered adoption settings. Designed to be scalable via donor screening
and simplex solvers. Optionally includes a pooled regression-adjustment intercept
(multisynth-like) estimated from pooled pre-treatment residuals across treated units.
